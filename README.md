# Spotify-Top-100-Songs-Data-driven-analysis

In the ever-evolving landscape of the music industry, understanding the characteristics and trends of popular songs is crucial for artists, producers, and marketers alike. This project aims to analyze the top 100 songs playlist on Spotify, providing insights into various audio features, genre distributions, and artist characteristics. By leveraging the Spotify API and the spotipy library, we have gathered and organized the data into a comprehensive pandas DataFrame.

Our analysis begins with a thorough examination of the dataset, including handling missing values and generating descriptive statistics. We then delve into visualizing the distribution of song durations and popularity, identifying the most popular songs, and exploring how audio features vary across different genres. Additionally, we investigate trends in song characteristics over the years and examine the correlations between various audio features.

A significant part of our analysis focuses on the artists behind the most popular tracks, highlighting their common characteristics and comparing the top artists based on popularity and the number of tracks in the playlist. Finally, we explore key musical attributes such as key, time signature, and mode distribution.

This project serves as a versatile template that can be easily adapted to analyze different playlists by simply updating the playlist details and adding more songs. It offers a valuable tool for music lovers to filter out songs according to their preferences based on various audio features, making it easier to discover new music that aligns with their tastes.

By providing a detailed overview of the current musical landscape, this project not only aids stakeholders in the music industry in making informed decisions but also enhances the listening experience for music enthusiasts.
